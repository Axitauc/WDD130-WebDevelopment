        I have always been interested in active education. I believe a person learns more by doing than by reading a book or listening to a lecture. Recruiters are aware of that. Have you seen these memes of 24-year-old college graduates being asked for 30 years of experience? This happens more often than you think, not exactly these scales but the example reflects my concern. That's why I thought of this website. There are people with incredible abilities, these kinds of people don't need to learn in a university how to do something, they are just born with gifts. Others are born with the gift of learning fast and generating success wherever they go. These situations are opportunities that everyone should have.

        <br>

The minimum compensation is hours of experience, the maximum is an income and letters of recommendation. Users will notice that we work with important companies, because the projects the students work on include simulated internships, but the real purpose of these is to prepare them to work with real companies in a legal way and according to their skills. <br />
        <br>

      <h3>What you will earn?</h3>
      <p>
        <b>COMMITMENT</b> <br />
        This platform initially implemented only in the United States, is now available in many countries. If you are a student what is required is an ID number from the country where you live, as well as proof that you are studying in an accredited school. This last measure serves to ensure that no matter how wonderful our site is, it will not replace your official study hours. You will also sign an agreement in which your work will always belong to your name, but the companies you work for will be able to share, use and disseminate it. Above all, we will need the permission of one of your proxies in a simple agreement. On the other hand, if you are a company interested in generating a partnership with our platform, we will need legal elements a little more detailed, but the most important thing is that you will sign an agreement guaranteeing that you will pay each student what is promised and that you will repeat their work as if they were a formal worker for you. <br />
        <br>
        <b>AVAILABLE WORLDWIDE</b> <br />
        We are the only universally verified platform that allows under-age students to gain experience, we have the recognition of many countries and companies. The results of our studies show that our users are more capable of facing the world and the labor field at the end of their graduation as users than many university students in the world. Companies love to see that someone has worked and succeeded with us, but mostly because the graduates and participants have real experience!<br />
