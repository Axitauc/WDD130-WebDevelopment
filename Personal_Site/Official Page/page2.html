            background of practice and skills. You will find how our site is
            divided and how we classify the users, the levels, and the types of
            retribution offered by each one. The minimum compensation is hours
            of experience, the maximum is an income and letters of
            recommendation. Users will notice that we work with important
            companies, because the projects the students work on include
            simulated internships, but the real purpose of these is to prepare
            them to work with real companies in a legal way and according to
            their skills.
